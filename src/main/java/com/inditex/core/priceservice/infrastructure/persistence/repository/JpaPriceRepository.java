     * product ID, brand ID, and application date. The query ensures that the price is within the valid date range
     * (between 'start_date' and 'end_date'), and selects the price with the highest priority (using 'ORDER BY priority DESC').
     * If there are multiple prices applicable at the same time, the one with the highest priority will be returned.

     * @param productId       the unique identifier of the product.
     * @param brandId         the unique identifier of the brand.
     * @return a {@link PriceEntity} representing the applicable price,
